  ## **Instructions** \nListen to all recordings of a person speaking. Then, move the sliders
  to **rate the quality of each audio file from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)**. The
  higher-quality audio files are the ones that are more natural sounding, or
  have fewer audio artifacts (e.g., clicks, pops, noise, or otherwise sound 'unnatural').
  **Note** - Each slider cannot be moved until its corresponding audio file has been listened to in its entirety."
